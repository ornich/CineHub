This Project was done by me when i was at 12th

The project is created in python and contains Tkinter as GUI,
the entry poing of the project is the login page from the login page
the persona can enter into the admin or the user aspect of the application.
If the persona is a user the database call is given and checks if the user has entered
the username and password correctly if not then the error will pop.
If the persona is an admin the same happens as per the user but the admin get a different
page which has add, delete, view members etc.

When a user enters the app the app will decide whether the user is a 
premium member or not based on the stored database data.
If the user is premium they get special privilages to get extra movies than
a normal user.
